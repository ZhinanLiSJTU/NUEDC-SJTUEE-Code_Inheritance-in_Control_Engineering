# SJTU EE Control Engineering Codebase for NUEDC
This repository is dedicated to helping SJTU EE students prepare for the National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest (NUEDC). The current projects were primarily developed in 2025 by Dehao Ye, Siying Chen, Zhinan Li and Fuhao Chen, Hanyu Zhou, Xin Chun, and are based on the MSPM0G3507 microcontroller and OpenMV platform.

As NUEDC is held biennially, most undergraduate students have only one opportunity to participate in the national competition. Many SJTU EE students opt for the Power Supply category, which, however, poses significant challenges for freshmen and sophomores due to the high demands on theoretical knowledge and practical skills. In contrast, the Control Engineering track may offer a more accessible entry point. Unfortunately, there has historically been limited knowledge transfer between teams, leading to repeated efforts and lost progress.

In 2025, only two teams chose the Control Engineering track and successfully completed the competitionâ€”the repository owner being part of one of them. While the results were not as strong as hoped, we believe our work represents a valuable starting point for future participants.

We warmly welcome all SJTU EE students to contribute your experiences, code, and project insights related to the Control Engineering track in NUEDC to this repository. Together, we can build a stronger foundation for those who follow.
