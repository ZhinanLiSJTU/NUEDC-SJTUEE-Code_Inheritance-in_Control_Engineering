# NUEDC-SJTUEE-Code_Inheritance_in_Control_Engineering
The repository is for SJTUEEers to prepare for NUEDC. Current projects are mostly programmed by Zhinan Li, Dehao Ye, Siying Chen, Fuhao Chen, Xin Chun, Hanyu Zhou in 2025. They are based on MSPM0G3507 and OpenMV.
As we know, NUEDC is held every two years, thus for the most undergraduate students, there is only one chance to take part in the national competition. Many SJTUEEers will choose power supply track. However, power supply track is especially unfriendly to freshmen and sophomores because of a lack of knowledge and experimental skills. It seems that control engineer track is an easier track.
